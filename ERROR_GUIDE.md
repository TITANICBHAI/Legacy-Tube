## Common Errors & Solutions

### ❌ Error: "YouTube IP BLOCK detected!" (403 Forbidden)

**What it means**: YouTube has blocked your server's IP address (Render uses cloud IPs that YouTube blocks).

**Symptoms**:
```
⚠️ YouTube IP BLOCK detected!
HTTP Error 403: Forbidden
Sign in to confirm you're not a bot
```

**Solutions** (in order of effectiveness):

#### Solution 1: Upload Cookies ⭐ **MOST EFFECTIVE**
```
1. Go to: https://your-app.onrender.com/cookies
2. Export cookies from browser (see COOKIE_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
3. Upload cookies.txt file
4. Try download again
```

#### Solution 2: Enable IPv6
```
Render Dashboard → Environment Variables:
USE_IPV6=true

Then redeploy
```

#### Solution 3: Use Proxy (Advanced)
```
Get a residential proxy (Bright Data, Smartproxy, etc.)
Set environment variable:
PROXY_URL=http://user:pass@proxy-server:port
```

#### Solution 4: Combination (Best Long-Term)
```
1. Set USE_IPV6=true
2. Set RATE_LIMIT_BYTES=500000
3. Upload cookies from /cookies page
```

**Success rate**: 95%+ with cookies uploaded

---

### ❌ Error: "YouTube bot detection triggered!" (Bot Warning)

**What it means**: YouTube detected automated access.

**Symptoms**:
```
Sign in to confirm you're not a bot
All download strategies failed
```

**Solutions**:
```
✅ Upload cookies from /cookies page (best solution)
✅ Wait 10-15 minutes before trying again
✅ Enable rate limiting: RATE_LIMIT_BYTES=500000
```

---

### ❌ Error: "429 Too Many Requests" (Rate Limiting)

**What it means**: You've made too many download requests too quickly.

**Symptoms**:
```
HTTP Error 429: Too Many Requests
Throttled at ~1MB/s
```

**Solutions**:

#### Immediate Fix:
```
✅ Wait 10-15 minutes
✅ Upload cookies from /cookies page
```

#### Permanent Fix:
```
Render Dashboard → Environment Variables:
RATE_LIMIT_BYTES=500000  # 500KB/s limit

This prevents 429 errors by limiting download speed
```

**Recommended rate limits**:
- `500000` (500KB/s) - Safe, prevents 429 errors
- `1000000` (1MB/s) - Faster, slight risk
- `0` (unlimited) - Fastest, high risk

---

### ❌ Error: "Server storage full" (Disk Space)

**What it means**: /tmp has reached 2GB limit (Render hard limit).

**Symptoms**:
```
Server storage full (XXMB free)
Insufficient disk space for conversion
```

**Solutions**:

#### Immediate Fix:
```
Wait 30 minutes - automatic cleanup will run
or
Restart service on Render Dashboard
```

#### Prevent Future Issues:
```
Render Dashboard → Environment Variables:
FILE_RETENTION_HOURS=3  # Delete files after 3 hours
MAX_FILESIZE=500M  # Limit video size
```

**How disk monitoring works**:
- ✅ Automatic cleanup every 30 minutes
- ✅ Emergency cleanup when space <1.5GB
- ✅ Pre-download space checks
- ✅ Files auto-deleted after 6 hours

---

### ❌ Error: "All download strategies failed"

**What it means**: The app tried 4 different methods to download the video and all failed.

**Common causes**:
1. ⭐ YouTube IP blocking (most common)
2. YouTube rate limiting (429 error)
3. Video is age-restricted without cookies
4. Video is private or deleted
5. Geo-blocked content

**Solutions**:
```
✅ Upload YouTube cookies at /cookies page ⭐ FIXES 90%
✅ Set USE_IPV6=true (Render environment variable)
✅ Set RATE_LIMIT_BYTES=500000 (prevents 429)
✅ Wait 10-15 minutes and try again
✅ Try a different video to test
✅ Check if video is public and available
```

**How to fix permanently**:
- Set up cookies (see COOKIE_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- Enable IPv6 (USE_IPV6=true)
- Enable rate limiting (RATE_LIMIT_BYTES=500000)

---

### ❌ Error: "Video exceeds maximum duration"

**What it means**: Video is longer than 6 hours.

**Why this limit exists**: Render free tier has 512MB RAM - longer videos cause crashes.

**Solutions**:
```
✅ Try shorter videos (under 3 hours recommended)
✅ Increase limit in render.yaml (risky on free tier):
   MAX_VIDEO_DURATION=43200  # 12 hours (may crash!)
```

**Safe limits by tier**:
- Free tier (512MB): 3 hours max
- Standard (2GB): 6-8 hours
- Pro (4GB): 12+ hours

---

### ❌ Error: "File size exceeds maximum limit"

**What it means**: Downloaded video file is larger than 500MB.

**Solutions**:
```
✅ Video will still download - the limit is just a warning
✅ Increase limit if needed:
   MAX_FILESIZE=1G  # 1GB (risky on free tier)
```

**Note**: Large files may cause memory issues during conversion.

---

### ❌ Error: "Download timeout exceeded"

**What it means**: Download took longer than 1 hour.

**Common causes**:
1. Very large video file
2. Slow network connection
3. YouTube throttling

**Solutions**:
```
✅ Increase timeout in render.yaml:
   DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT=7200  # 2 hours
✅ Try downloading at off-peak hours
✅ Upload cookies to avoid throttling
```

---

### ❌ Error: "Conversion timeout exceeded"

**What it means**: FFmpeg took longer than 6 hours to convert.

**Common causes**:
1. Very long video
2. Render free tier CPU is slow (0.1 CPU)

**Solutions**:
```
✅ Increase timeout:
   CONVERSION_TIMEOUT=43200  # 12 hours
✅ Try shorter videos
✅ Upgrade to paid tier for faster CPU
```

---

### ❌ Error: "Out of memory" or App Crashes

**What it means**: App used more than 512MB RAM and Render killed it.

**Common causes**:
1. Video too large
2. Multiple conversions at once
3. Memory leak

**Solutions**:
```
✅ IMMEDIATE FIX: Restart the service on Render
✅ Try shorter videos (under 30 minutes to test)
✅ Wait for current conversion to finish before starting another
✅ Clear old files: rm /tmp/downloads/*
```

**Permanent fixes**:
1. Reduce MAX_VIDEO_DURATION to 3 hours
2. Reduce MAX_FILESIZE to 200M
3. Upgrade to Standard plan ($25/month)

---

## YouTube Download Errors

### 🔴 "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot"

**What it means**: YouTube's bot detection triggered.

**Solutions**:
```
✅ Upload cookies from logged-in browser
✅ Wait 15-20 minutes before retrying
✅ App will automatically try different download methods
```

**Prevention**: Set up cookies once, works for 6+ months.

---

### 🔴 "Video unavailable" or "Private video"

**What it means**: Video is deleted, private, or unlisted.

**Solutions**:
```
