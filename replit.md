# YouTube to 3GP Converter for Feature Phones

## Overview
A web application that converts YouTube videos to 3GP format (176x144 resolution) optimized for feature phones like Nokia 5310 and old browsers like Opera Mini 4.4.39. Perfect for 2G networks with ultra-low file sizes.

## Current State
**Status**: Fully functional
- Flask web application running on port 5000
- Video download via yt-dlp (no API keys required)
- Automatic conversion to 3GP format using FFmpeg
- Background processing with status updates
- Automatic file cleanup (6-hour retention)
- No JavaScript - works on Opera Mini 4.4

## Recent Changes
**2025-10-21**: YouTube rate limit fixes for Render deployment
- **Added rate limit workarounds**: Fixed HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" errors on shared hosting
- **Force IPv4**: Uses `--force-ipv4` to bypass YouTube rate limiting
- **Custom User-Agent**: Mimics Chrome browser to avoid detection

### Video Conversion Settings
- **Maximum Duration**: Up to 6 hours (configurable via MAX_VIDEO_DURATION)
- **Download Timeout**: 60 minutes base (configurable via DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT)
- **Conversion Timeout**: 6 hours base, dynamic timeout of 2x video duration (configurable via CONVERSION_TIMEOUT)
- **Max File Size**: 500MB (configurable via MAX_FILESIZE)
- **Resolution**: 176x144 (with proper aspect ratio padding)
- **Format**: 3GP
- **Video Codec**: MPEG-4 (more compatible than H.263)

### User Flow
1. User pastes YouTube URL on homepage
2. Backend starts download in background thread
3. Status page shows "Processing..." with time estimates immediately
4. User manually refreshes to check status
5. When complete, download button appears
6. User downloads 3GP file (works on 2G)
7. File auto-deletes after 6 hours

## Deployment Notes
- Runs on port 5000 (required for Replit)
- Uses development Flask server (sufficient for personal use)
- No database required (JSON file for status)
- Automatic cleanup prevents storage overflow

## Hosting Options & Pricing

### Railway

- **Why it costs**: CPU usage for video conversion, storage for temporary files, bandwidth for downloads
- **Not recommended** for personal use due to costs

### Replit (Current Platform)
**Status**: Has free tier available
- **Free tier**: Limited to hobby projects, sufficient for personal use
- **Paid tier**: Starting at $7/month for more resources
- **Best for**: Personal projects, testing, development

### Render
**Status**: Limited free tier available
- **Free tier**: Available with restrictions (spins down after inactivity)
- **Cost**: ~$7/month for always-on instance
- **Good for**: Occasional use projects

### Fly.io
**Status**: Small free tier
