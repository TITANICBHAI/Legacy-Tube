Here's the master plan for your personal YouTube→3GP converter for Nokia 5310:

🎯 Project Architecture:
Stack:
Flask - Ultra-lightweight interface (like your chatbot)
yt-dlp - Downloads YouTube videos (free, no API needed)
FFmpeg - Converts to 3GP 176x144 (tiny resolution for 2G)
Background processing - Conversion happens async (user waits on status page)
Auto-cleanup - Files deleted after 2 hours
Railway/Render - Free hosting
User Flow:
Paste YouTube URL → Submit form
Processing page → Shows "Converting... may take 1-2 minutes"
Download ready → Big button: "Download 3GP"
2G-friendly → File stays available for 2 hours while you download
Technical Details:
Video Quality:

Resolution: 176x144 (perfect for Nokia screens)
Format: 3GP (only format feature phones support)
Audio: AMR codec (feature phone compatible)
Bitrate: Ultra-low (~64kbps) for tiny file sizes
Result: 3-5 minute video = ~2-3MB file
Storage Strategy:

Download → /tmp/downloads/ folder
Convert → save 3GP
Cleanup script runs every hour
Delete files older than 2 hours
Since it's just you, max 2-3 files at once
Performance:

Conversion time: 30-60 seconds per video
Your use only = won't hit free tier limits
Storage: ~100MB max at any time
Bandwidth: Minimal (just you downloading)
Interface (Opera Mini compatible):

📋 Implementation Plan:
I'll build this step by step:

Setup Flask app with ultra-lightweight design (copy chatbot structure)
Install yt-dlp + FFmpeg via system packages
Create download endpoint that accepts YouTube URLs
Build conversion logic with specific 3GP settings for Nokia
Add background processing so user sees progress
Implement auto-cleanup script for old files
Create simple interface optimized for Opera Mini
Add error handling for invalid URLs/failed downloads
Deploy to Railway with proper configuration
Test on Nokia 5310 to verify it works
