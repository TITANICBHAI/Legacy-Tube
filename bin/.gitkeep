# Pre-placing FFmpeg Binaries for Render Deployment
# 
# To avoid downloading FFmpeg every time Render builds your app:
#
# 1. Download static binaries:
#    https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/releases/ffmpeg-release-amd64-static.tar.xz
#
# 2. Extract and place in this folder:
#    - bin/ffmpeg
#    - bin/ffprobe
#
# 3. Make them executable:
#    chmod +x bin/ffmpeg bin/ffprobe
#
# 4. Commit to your repository (ignored by .gitignore but folder tracked)
#
# The build.sh script checks this folder FIRST before downloading,
# saving build time and avoiding download issues on Render.
