## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Video Processing = High CPU**
   - Most free tiers throttle CPU
   - Long videos (4-6 hours) may timeout
   - Consider limiting to 2-3 hour videos on free tiers

2. **Storage Management**
   - Your 6-hour auto-cleanup is perfect
   - Most free tiers have 1-3GB storage
   - Monitor disk usage

3. **Bandwidth**
   - YouTube download + 3GP upload = ~2x file size
   - 500MB video = ~1GB bandwidth
   - Free tiers: 100-160GB/month

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - YouTube may block shared IPs
   - Your current fixes should work
   - May need to add cookies for heavy use
